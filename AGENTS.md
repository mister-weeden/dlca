DLCA – Agent Handoff

Purpose
- 3D aneurysm detection on CTA NIfTI volumes; PyTorch 0.4.1; GPU-oriented.

Current Status
- No runs executed yet. User approved downloading checkpoint and sample image, but there is no GPU available.

CPU Compatibility Plan
- The current `inference.py` forces CUDA and `DataParallel`. To run on CPU:
  - Set device: `device = torch.device('cpu')`.
  - Remove `.cuda()` and `DataParallel(net)`; send tensors to `device` instead.
  - Wrap inference in `torch.no_grad()`; set `args.workers=0` to avoid shm issues.
- Minimal code edits (suggested):
  - Replace: `net = net.cuda(); loss = loss.cuda(); cudnn.benchmark = True; net = DataParallel(net)`
  - With: `device = torch.device('cpu'); net.to(device); net.eval()`
  - Replace `Variable(...).cuda()` with `...to(device)` and `with torch.no_grad():`.

Data/Weights
- Checkpoint (Google Drive): `trained_model.ckpt` into `./checkpoint/`.
- Test NIfTI (Google Drive): `brain_CTA.nii.gz` into `./test_image/brain_CTA/` (without the `.nii.gz` suffix in CLI arg).

CPU Inference (after edits)
- Example: `python inference.py -j=0 -b=1 --resume ./checkpoint/trained_model.ckpt --input ./test_image/brain_CTA --output ./prediction/brain_CTA --n_test 1`
- Outputs: `*_pbb.npy` plus visualizations from `plot_box`.

Next Steps
- Implement CPU edits, download assets, run inference on sample image, attach outputs.
- Longer‑term: restore GPU path when available for training/benchmarking.

AmazonQ – Pick Up Here
- Apply CPU compatibility edits to `inference.py` as above (no functional changes besides device handling).
- Download checkpoint and sample test image into the specified folders.
- Run the CPU inference command with `-j 0` and confirm predictions are saved.

Sync Points
- Shared scratch (create on GPU host): `/lustre/scratch/dlca/{checkpoint,inputs,prediction,logs}`
- Helper: `bash bin/create_syncpoints.sh`
